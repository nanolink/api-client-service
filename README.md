# api-client-service
A node project which uses Nanolink api's for mirroring data, using NL's graphQL subscriptions.

Clone the project, open it in vscode, change the ENV variables in launch.json accordingly, and hit F5 to run.

You will need at least to change the ENV variables:<br>
CORESERVER<br>
APITOKEN<br>

These two values you can receive from Nanolink support.
